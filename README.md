# Social Network API 

## Description
This repository contains the backend code for a social network site. It uses MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database, and an Express server. It also uses Mongoose as the ODM in order to interact with the MongoDB database. <br/>

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social network sites due to its speed with large amounts of data, and flexibility with unstructured data. <br/>

This application has the backend code set-up to create users, allow users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 

## Installation
This application uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and day.js. To install necessary dependencies, run the following command: 
```
npm install
```
